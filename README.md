# Frontend Playground ðŸ¥³

Welcome!

I use this repository to track interesting front-end learning tools that I find. 

The crux of this repository is the directory named `/tutorials-playground`; this contains a React app that I built to record lessons I learned in React... using React.
So it is sort of a double learning as building this app both helped me learn and document these lessons. 

It is something I come back to often and add to each time!

The other directories mainly contain markdown documenting other various lessons I have learned or good sources I have found.
